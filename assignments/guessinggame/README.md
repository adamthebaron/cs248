#Background info:
"Guessing Game" is a very simple program that I wrote to get acquainted
with Java's syntax. 

#Instructions:
For this assignment, you are to write a program that plays the Guessing Game. Your program should first pick a random number between 1 and 100. Then the user guesses the number. Your program should say whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. If the guess was correct, the program stops. Otherwise, the user gets to guess again.

Your program must include at least one function/method to receive full credit.

##Extra Credit:
1. For 2 points of extra credit, after the game is over, ask the user if he/she wants to play again. If so, choose a new random number and start over. The user should be allowed to play as many times as he/she desires.

2. For another 3 points of extra credit, have the computer display different insults. The idea is to pick a random number and use if statements to decide which insult to use. Use a list of at least 5 possible insults. 

NOTE: The insult chosen must not, in any way, depend on how close the user is to guessing the number, or depend on whether they are too high or low.

###Other Notes:
1. Don't forget to write comments, and remember to indent properly. Include pre- and post-conditions for your functions/methods. (That is, the comments should state what the function does, and what it needs to do it.)

2. Do not try any of the extra credit until after you have completed the basic assignment.
