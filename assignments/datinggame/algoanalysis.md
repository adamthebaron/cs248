#Algorithm Analysis (Big O Notation)

Big O Notataion describes functions that express runtime of algorithms, but not necessarily (and not really usually) programs.

##Examples (where n is input size):

O(I) = constant factor
O(n^2) = quadratic factor
O(nlog(n))
O(n^3)
O(2^n)
//TODO: Explain input sizes
